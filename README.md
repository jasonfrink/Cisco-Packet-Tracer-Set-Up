# Cisco Packet Tracer â€“ Basic Switch Configuration and VLAN Setup

Introduction

Networking professionals and students often use Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate and test network configurations in a controlled environment. This project aims to guide users through the installation and setup of Packet Tracer, basic switch configuration, and VLAN assignments. By following these steps, users will gain hands-on experience in configuring a simple network with VLANs, which is a critical skill in enterprise networking.

This project will cover:

Installing and setting up Cisco Packet Tracer
Creating a simple network topology
Configuring basic switch settings
Assigning VLANs and verifying connectivity

Sections 

1.  Building a Simple Network Topology
-  Add a Cisco 2960 switch to the workspace
-  Add three end devices (PCs) and connect them to the switch using Ethernet cables
-  Assign static IP addresses to the PCs for network testing

The network will intially be set up with two PCs and a switch, connected by a straight-through cable as shown in the image below. Satic addresses will be assigned to the PCs.

Configuring the static IP address:

Current network configuration:

We test the connection by pinging PC1 from PC0 which is successful.

2. Creating and Assigning VLANs - Configuring the Switch
-  Create VLAN 2 (User VLAN) and VLAN 3 (Finance Dept. VLAN)
-  Assign the correct VLANs to the respective ports
-  Set access ports to restrict communication between VLANs
-  Verify VLAN configurations using show VLAN command
-  Test connectivity with Ping command

Use the switch CLI to set up the VLANs:

Use the Switch CLI to set up access port and assign respective VLAN:

Check to see if the access ports have been assigned correctly:

Ping request from PC0 to PC1 should fail if access ports configured properly:

3. Add PC2 to network
-  Configure PC2 with static IP
-  Assign PC2 to to VLAN3
-  Ensure VLAN separation and functionality
-  Use the ping command to test connectivity between PCs

The final network will look like this:

PC2 is added using the same process as PC0 and PC1. PC2 will be part of VLAN 3 (Finance Department). The access port and VLAN assigment will also be the same as the steps to configure PC0 and PC1.

The access port for PC2 has been configured for VLAN3.

A pring request is used to confirm the connection for PC1 and PC2.
