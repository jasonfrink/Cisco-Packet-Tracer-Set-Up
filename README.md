# Cisco Packet Tracer â€“ Basic Switch Configuration and VLAN Setup

Introduction

Networking professionals and students often use Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate and test network configurations in a controlled environment. This project aims to guide users through the installation and setup of Packet Tracer, basic switch configuration, and VLAN assignments. By following these steps, users will gain hands-on experience in configuring a simple network with VLANs, which is a critical skill in enterprise networking.

This project will cover:

Installing and setting up Cisco Packet Tracer
Creating a simple network topology
Configuring basic switch settings
Assigning VLANs and verifying connectivity

Sections 

1.  Building a Simple Network Topology
-  Add a Cisco 2960 switch to the workspace
-  Add three end devices (PCs) and connect them to the switch using Ethernet cables
-  Assign static IP addresses to the PCs for network testing

The network will intially be set up with two PCs and a switch, connected by a straight-through cable as shown in the image below. Satic addresses will be assigned to the PCs.

We test the connection by pinging PC1 from PCO which is successful.

2. Creating and Assigning VLANs - Configuring the Switch
-  Create VLAN 2 (User VLAN) and VLAN 3 (Finance Dept. VLAN)
-  Assign the correct VLANs to the respective ports
-  Set access ports to restrict communication between VLANs

3. Verifying Connectivity and VLAN Segmentation
-  Use the ping command to test connectivity between PCs
-  Verify VLAN configurations using show VLAN command
-  Ensure VLAN separation and functionality
