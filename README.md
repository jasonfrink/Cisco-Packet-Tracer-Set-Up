# Cisco Packet Tracer â€“ Basic Switch Configuration and VLAN Setup

Introduction

Networking professionals and students often use Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate and test network configurations in a controlled environment. This project aims to guide users through the installation and setup of Packet Tracer, basic switch configuration, and VLAN assignments. By following these steps, users will gain hands-on experience in configuring a simple network with VLANs, which is a critical skill in enterprise networking.

This project will cover:

Installing and setting up Cisco Packet Tracer
Creating a simple network topology
Configuring basic switch settings
Assigning VLANs and verifying connectivity

Sections 

1.  Building a Simple Network Topology
-  Add a Cisco 2960 switch to the workspace
-  Add two end devices (PCs) and connect them to the switch using Ethernet cables
-  Assign static IP addresses to the PCs for network testing

2.  Configuring the Switch
-  Access the CLI (Command Line Interface) of the switch
-  Navigate through different modes (User EXEC, Privileged EXEC, and Global Configuration)
-  Verify initial settings using show commands

3. Creating and Assigning VLANs
-  Create VLAN 2 (User VLAN) and VLAN 3 (Engineering VLAN)
-  Assign the correct VLANs to the respective ports
-  Set access ports to restrict communication between VLANs

4. Verifying Connectivity and VLAN Segmentation
-  Use the ping command to test connectivity between PCs
-  Verify VLAN configurations using show VLAN command
-  Ensure VLAN separation and functionality
