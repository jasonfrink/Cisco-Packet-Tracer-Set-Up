# Cisco Packet Tracer â€“ Basic Switch Configuration and VLAN Setup

Introduction

Networking professionals and students often use Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate and test network configurations in a controlled environment. This project aims to guide users through the installation and setup of Packet Tracer, basic switch configuration, and VLAN assignments. By following these steps, users will gain hands-on experience in configuring a simple network with VLANs, which is a critical skill in enterprise networking.

This project will cover:

Installing and setting up Cisco Packet Tracer
Creating a simple network topology
Configuring basic switch settings
Assigning VLANs and verifying connectivity

Sections 

1.  Building a Simple Network Topology
-  Add a Cisco 2960 switch to the workspace
-  Add three end devices (PCs) and connect them to the switch using Ethernet cables
-  Assign static IP addresses to the PCs for network testing

The network will intially be set up with two PCs and a switch, connected by a straight-through cable as shown in the image below. Satic addresses will be assigned to the PCs.

Current network configuration:

We test the connection by pinging PC1 from PC0 which is successful.

2. Creating and Assigning VLANs - Configuring the Switch
-  Create VLAN 2 (User VLAN) and VLAN 3 (Finance Dept. VLAN)
-  Assign the correct VLANs to the respective ports
-  Set access ports to restrict communication between VLANs
-  Verify VLAN configurations using show VLAN command
-  Test connectivity with Ping command

Use the switch CLI to set up the VLANs:

Use the Switch CLI to set up access port and assign respective VLAN:

Check to see if the access ports have been assigned correctly:

Ping request from PC0 to PC1 should fail if access ports configured properly:

3. Add PC02 to network
-  Configure PC02 with static IP
-  Assign PC03 to to VLAN3
-  Ensure VLAN separation and functionality
-  Use the ping command to test connectivity between PCs
